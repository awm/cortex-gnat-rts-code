========

This release includes GNAT Ada Run Time Systems (RTSs) based
on FreeRTOS (http://www.freertos.org) and targeted at boards with
Cortex-M3, -M4, -M4F MCUs (Arduino Due from http://www.arduino.org,
the STM32F4-series evaluation boards from STMicroelectronics at
http://www.st.com).

In each case, the board support for the RTS (configuration for size
and location of Flash, RAM; clock initialization; interrupt naming) is
in $RTS/adainclude. Support for the on-chip peripherals is also
included, in Ada spec files generated by SVD2Ada
(https://github.com/AdaCore/svd2ada).

The Ada source is either original or based on FSF GCC (mainly 4.9.1,
some later releases too).

(1) arduino-due is a Ravenscar-style RTOS based on FreeRTOS from
    http://www.freertos.org for the Arduino Due.

    See arduino-due/COPYING* for licensing terms.

    On-chip peripheral support in atsam3x8e/.

    Tests in test-arduino-due/.

(2) stm32f4 is a Ravenscar-style RTOS based on FreeRTOS from
    http://www.freertos.org for the STM32F4-DISC* board.

    See stm32f4/COPYING* for licensing terms.

    On-chip peripheral support in stm32f40x/.

    Tests in test-stm32f4/.

(3) stm32f429i is a Ravenscar-style RTOS based on FreeRTOS from
    http://www.freertos.org for the STM32F429I-DISC* board.

    See stm32f429i/COPYING* for licensing terms.

    On-chip peripheral support in stm32f429x/.

    Tests in test-stm32f429i/.

In this release,

* There is no longer any dependence on the STMicroelectronics'
  STM32Cube package.

* The support for on-chip peripherals is limited to the
  SVD2Ada-generated spec files. The AdaCore 'bareboard' software
  (currently https://github.com/AdaCore/bareboard, but a name change
  is under consideration) supports the STM32 line.

* Tasking no longer requires an explicit start
  (https://sourceforge.net/p/cortex-gnat-rts/tickets/5/).

* Locking in interrupt-handling protected objects no longer inhibits
  all interrupts, only those of equal or lower priority
  (https://sourceforge.net/p/cortex-gnat-rts/tickets/18/).

ones) are:
