========

This release includes an RTS for the Arduino Due, arduino-due, and a
minimal BSP, arduino-due-bsp.

For the STM32F429I-DISCO, there is one RTS, stm32f429i-disco-rtos, and
one BSP, stm32f429i-disco-bsp.

In this release,

* the Containers support generalized iteration ("for all E of C
  loop"). Note, this is achieved by removing tampering checks. While
  tampering errors are rare, it would be as well to check algorithms
  using a fully-featured desktop compiler.

* FreeRTOS is configured to detect stack overflow (if it is detected,
  the RTS loops inside vApplicationStackOverflowHook()).

implementation-specific, ones) are:
