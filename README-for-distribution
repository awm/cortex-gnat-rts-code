========

This release includes an RTS for the Arduino Due.

There is one RTS, stm32f429i-disco-rtos, and one BSP,
stm32f429i-disco-bsp.

There have been no changes to the RTS from the previous release:

The following tickets have been fixed:

13  Duration should be 64-bit
16  Can't use secondary stack from main program

A beginning has been made on ticket 7, Project structure is
inflexible: the common code between the RTSs and the tests has been
extracted (to common/ and test-common/ respectively).

Ticket 11 can't be fixed in this project, but is fixed in GNAT GPL
2015 and FSF GCC 5.1.0.
