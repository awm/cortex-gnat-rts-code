========

This release has been reorganised from previous releases.

There is one RTS, stm32f429i-disco-rtos, and one BSP,
stm32f429i-disco-bsp.

Changes to the RTS from the previous release:
---------------------------------------------

These units (and supporting units) are now included:

  Ada.Containers.Bounded_Vectors (*)
  Ada.Containers.Bounded_Hashed_Maps (*)
  Ada.Containers.Generic_Array_Sort
  Ada.Containers.Generic_Constrained_Array_Sort
  Ada.IO_Exceptions
  Ada.Streams
  Ada.Task_Identification
  Interfaces.C
  Interfaces.C.Strings
  System.Assertions

  (*) The new iterators (for some F in Foo loop ...) are NOT supported
      (they require finalization).

The STM32F429I_Discovery tree has been moved to the BSP.

The following tickets have been fixed:

  2  Protected spec hides package Interfaces
  14 Last_Chance_Handler doesnâ€™t stop tasking

Tasking is started by calling Start_FreeRTOS_Scheduler.
