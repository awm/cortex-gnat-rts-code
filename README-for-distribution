========

This release includes

* an RTS for the Arduino Due, arduino-due, and a minimal BSP,
  arduino-due-bsp.

* an RTS for the STM32F429I-DISCO, stm32f429i-disco-rtos, based on
  STMicroelectronics' STM32Cube package and FreeRTOS, and a
  corresponding partial BSP, stm32f429i-disco-bsp.

* an RTS for the STM32F429I-DISCO, stm32f429i, based on FreeRTOS, with
  a set of peripheral definition packages created by SVD2Ada.

In this release,

* the Containers support generalized iteration ("for all E of C
  loop"). Note, this is achieved by removing tampering checks. While
  tampering errors are rare, it would be as well to check algorithms
  using a fully-featured desktop compiler.
