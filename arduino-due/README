This is an Ada Runtime System (RTS) for the GCC Ada compiler (GNAT),
targeted to the Arduino Due board (see http://www.arduino.org/).

The RTS supports Ravenscar tasking. Package System contains the
following additional restrictions:

   pragma Restrictions (No_Enumeration_Maps);
   pragma Restrictions (No_Exception_Propagation);
   pragma Restrictions (No_Finalization);
   pragma Restrictions (No_Recursion);

The RTS is supplied built for debugging (-g) and with suitable
optimisation (-Og), using GNAT GPL 2015[1] on Mac OS X (it should work
out of the box with a Linux-hosted GNAT GPL 2015 cross-compiler, but
will need recompiling for another compiler). A test program is
included.

The RTS is intended to support commercial binary distributions. The
Ada source code has either been derived from FSF GCC (4.9.1) or
written for this work; see the files COPYING3 and COPYING.RUNTIME.

The RTS is based on FreeRTOS[2]. See COPYING.FreeRTOS.

The following non-original files don't form part of a binary
deliverable, so don't affect the status of the binary:

o build_runtime.gpr and runtime.xml originated in AdaCore's GNAT GPL
  2014 arm-eabi distribution (for Linux).

o The linker script due-flash.ld is under an MIT licence: see
  COPYING.MIT.
