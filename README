This project contains various GNAT Ada Run Time Systems (RTSs) based
on FreeRTOS (http://www.freertos.org) and targeted at boards with
Cortex-M3, -M4, -M4F MCUs (Arduino Due from http://www.arduino.org,
the STM32F4-series evaluation boards from STMicroelectronics at
http://www.st.com). A particular release may not contain all of the
RTSs.

In each case, the board support for the RTS (configuration for size
and location of Flash, RAM; clock initialization; interrupt naming) is
in $RTS/adainclude. Support for the on-chip peripherals is also
included, in Ada spec files generated by SVD2Ada
(https://github.com/AdaCore/svd2ada).

The Ada source is either original or based on FSF GCC (mainly 4.9.1,
some later releases too).
