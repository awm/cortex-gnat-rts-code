This project contains various GNAT Ada Run Time Systems (RTSs) based
on FreeRTOS (http://www.freertos.org) and targeted at boards with
Cortex-M3, -M4, -M4F MCUs (Arduino Due from http://www.arduino.org,
the STM32F4-series evaluation boards from STMicroelectronics at
http://www.st.com). A particular release may not contain all of the
RTSs.

(1) arduino-due is a Ravenscar-style RTOS based on FreeRTOS from
    http://www.freertos.org.

    See arduino-due/COPYING* for licensing terms.

    Tests in test-arduino-due/.

    arduino-due-bsp/ contains some initial support for board
    peripherals.

(2) stm32f429i is a Ravenscar-style RTOS based on FreeRTOS from
    http://www.freertos.org.

    See stm32f429i/COPYING* for licensing terms.

    Board support (spec files only) is included in the RTS.

    Tests in test-stm32f429i/.

(3) stm32f429i-disco-rtos is a Ravenscar-style RTS based on the ST
    Cube BSPs from STMicroelectronics and their packaged FreeRTOS
    kernel. The Ada source is based on GCC 4.9.1.

    See stm32f429i-disco-rtos/COPYING* for licensing terms.

    Tests in test-stm32f4/.
    Demos in demo-stm32f429i-disco-rtos/.

    Board support in stm32f429i-disco-bsp/.
