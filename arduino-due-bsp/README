This is a Board Support Package (BSP) for the Arduino Due (see
http://www.arduino.org/) in Ada for the GCC Ada compiler (GNAT) using
the Runtime System (RTS) arduino-due.

The BSP is supplied built with for debugging (-g) and with suitable
optimisation (-Og), using GNAT GPL 2015[1] on Mac OS X (it should work
out of the box with a Linux-hosted GNAT GPL 2015 cross-compiler, but
will need recompiling for another compiler).

The BSP is intended to support commercial binary distributions. The
Ada source code has been written for this work; see the files COPYING3
and COPYING.RUNTIME.
