This is a Board Support Package (BSP) for the STMicroelectronics
STM32F429I Discovery board (see http://www.st.com/) in Ada for the GCC
Ada compiler (GNAT) using the Runtime System (RTS)
stm324f29i-disco-rtos.

The RTS contains object code for all the relevant drivers from
STMicroelectronics' STM32Cube_FW_F4_V1.10.0 package, but not the
source code. This BSP contains packages to support the user
pushbutton, the user LEDs, and the LCD, as well as a package
(stm32f429xx_h.ads) containing machine-generated interfaces to all the
board hardware. To use the last, you need STMicroelectronics' manual
RM0090 (DocID018909).

The BSP is supplied built with for debugging (-g) and with suitable
optimisation (-Og), using  GNAT GPL 2015[1] on Mac OS X (it
should work out of the box with a Linux-hosted GNAT GPL 2015
cross-compiler, but will need recompiling for another compiler).

The BSP is intended to support commercial binary
distributions[2]. stm32f429xx_h.ads is derived from STMicroelectronics
source supplied in STMCube and is subject to their copyright; see the
file COPYING.STMicroelectronics. Other Ada source code has been
written for this work; see the files COPYING3 and COPYING.RUNTIME.

[2] STMicroelectronics' evaluation product licence agreement at
www.st.com/epla forbids the sale of products including this board, so
this work would have to be reconfigured for a different board anyway.
