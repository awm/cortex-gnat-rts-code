This is an Ada Runtime System (RTS) for the GCC Ada compiler (GNAT),
targeted to the STMicroelectronics STM32F429I Discovery board (see
http://www.st.com/).

The RTS is a true zero-footprint system. Package System contains the
following restrictions:

   pragma Restrictions (No_Allocators);
   pragma Restrictions (No_Delay);
   pragma Restrictions (No_Dispatch);
   pragma Restrictions (No_Enumeration_Maps);
   pragma Restrictions (No_Exception_Propagation);
   pragma Restrictions (No_Finalization);
   pragma Restrictions (No_Implicit_Dynamic_Code);
   pragma Restrictions (No_Protected_Types);
   pragma Restrictions (No_Recursion);
   pragma Restrictions (No_Secondary_Stack);
   pragma Restrictions (No_Tasking);

The RTS contains object code for all the relevant drivers from
STMicroelectronics' STM32Cube_FW_F4_V1.3.0 package, but not the source
code. Makefile.inc (altered as necessary to match the place where you
have installed the STM32Cube package) can be included in your own
Makefiles to provide access to the drivers' header and source files;
see the demonstration's Makefile.

The RTS has been built with no optimisation (-O0) and for debugging
(-g), using GNAT GPL 2014 for arm-eabi-darwin-bin[1] on Mac OS X (it
should work out of the box with a Linux-hosted cross-compiler). Ada, C
and C++ demo programs are included.

The RTS is intended to support commercial binary distributions[2]. The
Ada source code has either been derived from FSF GCC (4.9.1) or
written for this work; see the files COPYING3 and COPYING.RUNTIME. The
C source has either been derived from STMCube or written for this
work: see the file COPYING.STMicroelectronics.

The following non-original files don't form part of a binary
deliverable, so don't affect the status of the binary:

o build_runtime.gpr and runtime.xml are copied from AdaCore's GNAT GPL
  2014 arm-eabi distribution (for Linux).

o The linker script stm32f429i-flash.ld is under an MIT licence: see
  COPYING.MIT.

[2] STMicroelectronics' evaluation product licence agreement at
www.st.com/epla forbids the sale of products including this board, so
this work would have to be reconfigured for a different board anyway.
