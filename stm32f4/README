This is an Ada Runtime System (RTS) for the GCC Ada compiler (GNAT),
targeted to the STMicroelectronics STM32F429I Discovery board (see
http://www.st.com/).

The RTS supports Ravenscar tasking. Package System contains the
following additional restrictions:

   pragma Restrictions (No_Enumeration_Maps);
   pragma Restrictions (No_Exception_Propagation);
   pragma Restrictions (No_Finalization);
   pragma Restrictions (No_Recursion);

The RTS is supplied built for debugging (-g) and with suitable
optimisation (-Og), using GNAT GPL 2015[1] on Mac OS X (it should work
out of the box with a Linux-hosted GNAT GPL 2015 cross-compiler, but
will need recompiling for another compiler). Demo programs are
included.

The RTS is intended to support commercial binary distributions. The
Ada source code has either been derived from FSF GCC (4.9.1) or
written for this work; see the files COPYING3 and COPYING.RUNTIME.

The RTS is based on FreeRTOS[2]. See COPYING.FreeRTOS.

Board support (spec files only) is generated using a forked svd2ada[3].

The following non-original files don't form part of a binary
deliverable, so don't affect the status of the binary:

o build_runtime.gpr and runtime.xml originated in AdaCore's GNAT GPL
  2014 arm-eabi distribution (for Linux).

o The linker script stm32f429i-flash.ld is under an MIT licence: see
  COPYING.MIT.
