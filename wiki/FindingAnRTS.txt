The GNAT compiler running under gprbuild can find RTSs in various ways. An RTS usually contains an `adainclude/` directory with the source of the RTS and an `adalib/` directory with the corresponding library, linker script and `.ali` files (these defaults can be changed by listing the source directory, or colon-separated directories, in `ada_source_path`, and the object directory in `ada_object_path`).

If not the default, the RTS can be named on the command using a `--RTS=` option. In a GPR, you can do this in package Builder (so it's applied during all phases of the build):

    package Builder is
       for Default_Switches ("ada") use
         (
          "-g",
          "-O0",
          "--RTS=stm32f429i-disco-rtos"
         );
    end Builder;

or, with GPRBUILD GPL 2015, via an attribute:

    for Runtime ("ada") use "stm32f429i-disco-rtos";

There are two places where RTSs can be installed:

* in the location indicated by `arm-eabi-gcc -print-libgcc-file-name`; for GNAT GPL 2015, that would be `$prefix/lib/gcc/arm-eabi/4.9.3/`, referred to from here as `$lib`.
* in `$prefix/arm-eabi/lib/gnat`.

In `$lib`:
----

The directory containing the RTS should be called `rts-{name}`, for example `rts-stm32f429i-disco-rtos`.

If the RTS is named `stm32f429i-disco-rtos`, the compiler will treat it as the default RTS (and you need a default RTS) if

* `$lib` contains text files `ada_object_path`, `ada_source_path` containing the locations of the `adalib` and `adainclude` directories of the RTS respectively, and (GCC 5.0) there is a file `adainclude/system.ads`; or
* `$lib` contains symbolic links named `adalib` and `adainclude` to the `adalib` and `adainclude` directories of the RTS respectively.

Alternative RTSs are found here if they are in directories named `rts-{name}`, for example `rts-stm32f429i-disco-rtos/` corresponds to `--RTS=stm32f429i-disco-rtos`.

RTSs can also be located by giving the explicit path in the `Runtime ("ada")` attribute or the `--RTS=` option (this has to be an absolute path with GPRBUILD GPL 2015):

    package Builder is
       for Default_Switches ("ada") use
         (
          "-g",
          "-O0",
          "--RTS=“ & Project’Project_Dir & "../stm32f429i-disco-rtos"
         );
    end Builder;

or

    for Runtime ("ada") use Project’Project_Dir & "../stm32f429i-disco-rtos";

In `$prefix/arm-eabi/lib/gnat`:
----

The directory containing the RTS is just called `{name}`, e.g. `stm32f429i-disco-rtos`.
