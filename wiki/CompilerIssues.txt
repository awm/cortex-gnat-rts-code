There are some source code constructs that, while perfectly legal and working under desktop compilations, cause errors with this RTS. This is probably caused by misunderstanding of the exact interface between the compiler and the RTS, which is complex (to put it mildly).

Compiler mistakes restriction violation [tickets:11]
====

A package containing an instantiation of `Ada.Containers.Bounded_Vectors` couldn’t be linked because the compiler (GCC 4.9.1 and GNAT GPL 2014) had mistakenly decided that it violated the restriction `No_Implicit_Heap_Allocations` (which is part of the Ravenscar profile).

GCC 5.0.0 doesn’t have this error.

A workround (which allowed the package which revealed the problem to be built) was to explicitly state the restriction in the body:

    :::ada
    pragma Restrictions (No_Implicit_Heap_Allocations);

    with Ada.Containers.Bounded_Vectors;

    package body Containing is

       subtype Index is Natural range 0 .. 19;
       subtype Line is String (1 .. 20);

       package Line_Vectors
         is new Ada.Containers.Bounded_Vectors (Index_Type   => Index,
                                                Element_Type => Line);

`Attach_Handler` must be in pragma form
====

In this code

    :::ada
    protected Button
    with
      Interrupt_Priority => System.Interrupt_Priority'First
    is
       entry Wait_For_Trigger;
    private
       Triggered : Boolean := False;
       procedure Handler;
       pragma Attach_Handler (Handler, Ada.Interrupts.Names.EXTI0_IRQ);
    end Button;

you would have liked to attach the handler using the aspect syntax,

    :::ada
       procedure Handler
       with
         Attach_Handler => Ada.Interrupts.Names.EXTI0_IRQ;

but this doesn’t work in GCC 4.9.1 (it’s OK in GNAT GPL 2014 & GCC 5.0.0).
