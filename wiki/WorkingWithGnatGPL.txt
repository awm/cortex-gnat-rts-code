C library
====

These RTSs need a C library. The GNAT GPL cross-compiler as supplied by AdaCore for Linux and Windows doesn't include a C library, so you'll need to build your own and install it. These instructions are for Linux; for Windows, at least the `--prefix` setting will need to change to match your compiler.

Obtain [Newlib](https://sourceware.org/newlib/), unpack it into `newlib-2.2.0` (or later version, of course). You'll need to build in a parallel directory (in other words, *don't* `configure` in the source directory!). Assuming your GNAT GPL 2015 compiler is installed at /opt/gnat-gpl-2015,

    mkdir newlib-2.2.0-build
    cd newlib-2.2.0-build
    ../newlib-2.2.0/configure \
      --build=x86_64-pc-linux-gnu \
      --target=arm-eabi \
      --prefix=/opt/gnat-gpl-2015 \
      --with-arch=armv7 \
      --with-mode-thumb \
      --enable-multilib \
      --with-gnu-as \
      --with-gnu-ld \
      --disable-nls \
      --disable-newlib-supplied-syscalls

and then make and install:

    $ make
    $ sudo make install
