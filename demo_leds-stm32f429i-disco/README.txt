This example is similar to that used used by the tutorial located in the GNAT Pro User's Guide Supplement for Cross Platforms.  The tutorial is in the Annex titled "Tutorial: Embedded ARM Ada Project."

It was changed because it is for a different board (the STM32F429I Discovery), which has a different runtime system and (importantly from the point of view of the demonstration) only two LEDs; rather than altering the direction of movement of the cycling LEDs, the rate of cycling is altered.

The User's Guide Supplement is accessible within GPS via the Help menu.  It is also available on disk in various formats, under the "share/doc/gnat-cross" folder tree located under the compiler installation directory.  The specific file is named "gnat_ugx.*", where the extension "*" reflects the file type.  For example, the PDF version is named "gnat_ugx.pdf" and is located in the "share/doc/gnat-cross/pdf" folder.  Other formats are located in specific directories at the same level as the "pdf/" directory.

The tutorial explains how and when to start GPS on the project.
